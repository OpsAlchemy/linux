# Linux Data Streams, STDIO, and Pipelines Documentation

## Overview
A **data stream** in Unix and Linux is a continuous flow of text data passed from one file, device, or program to another, usually via **Standard Input/Output (STDIO)**. Streams are the foundational building blocks of Unix philosophy:

> *"Write programs that do one thing and do it well. Write programs to work together. Write programs to handle text streams, because that is a universal interface."* â€” *Doug McIlroy*

## STDIO File Handles

There are three default STDIO streams:

- **STDIN** (File handle 0): Standard Input (usually the keyboard).
- **STDOUT** (File handle 1): Standard Output (usually the display).
- **STDERR** (File handle 2): Standard Error (also the display).

These are implemented in C using the `stdio.h` header. Each STDIO stream is opened automatically when a program starts.

- STDIN can be redirected from any file (even device files).
- STDOUT can be redirected to files or piped to other programs.
- STDERR is independent and by default sent to the screen.

Redirection makes it possible to separate output from errors, improving usability in scripts and pipelines.

## Basic Commands and Their Outputs

```bash
[root@studentvm1 ~]# dmesg
[root@studentvm1 ~]# lsblk -i
```

View disk partitions:

```bash
[root@studentvm1 ~]# fdisk -l /dev/sdb
[root@studentvm1 ~]# mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt
```

Ensure you verify the USB drive path on your VM before running commands. It may vary (e.g., `/dev/sdb`, `/dev/sdc`).

---

## Generating Data Streams with `yes`

The `yes` command generates a continuous stream of data. It can:

- Demonstrate piping behavior
- Confirm deletions automatically
- Fill storage for testing

Example:

```bash
[student@studentvm1 ~]$ yes 123465789-abcdefg
```

Interrupt using `Ctrl+C` (^C).

To test deletion confirmation:

```bash
yes | rm *
ll
```

Make sure `/mnt` is the current working directory before executing the above.

---

## Filling a Drive (Testing Directory Full Scenarios)

1. Watch filesystem usage:

```bash
[root@studentvm1 ~]# watch -n 1 df -h
```

2. Fill with repeating data:

```bash
[root@studentvm1 ~]# yes 123456789-abcdefgh >> /mnt/testfile.txt
```

3. Clean up:

```bash
[root@studentvm1 ~]# rm -f /mnt/testfile.txt ; umount /mnt
```

### Real-World Use Case
When `/tmp` is full, GUI login may fail because desktop sessions write to `/tmp`. CLI logins may still work because they don't need `/tmp` writes.

---

## Exploring Disk with `dd`

Read the boot sector:

```bash
[root@studentvm1 ~]# dd if=/dev/sdb bs=512 count=1
```

- Useful for analyzing partition layout.
- Binary and unreadable without interpretation.

Understanding that `dd` can also read from partition devices (e.g., `/dev/sdb1`) helps in studying filesystem structures.

If trying to locate file data manually, you may:
- Start reading from the first partition
- Skip empty space between boot sector and first partition
- Use `less` to scroll output if terminal is too small

---

## Working with Random Data

Generate random bytes for testing or data wiping:

```bash
[student@studentvm1 ~]$ od -c -N 50 < /dev/urandom
```

Use `dd` to write random data to a disk (be cautious!):

```bash
[root@studentvm1 ~]# dd if=/dev/urandom of=/dev/sda
```

This is useful for:
- Data destruction
- Forensics testing
- Ensuring irrecoverable deletions

Alternative: Use `shred` for secure file erasure:

```bash
[root@studentvm1 ~]# shred -vzn 3 /dev/sdb
```

- `-v`: verbose
- `-z`: add a final pass of zeros
- `-n 3`: overwrite 3 times

---

## Piping and Pipelines

The `|` operator allows output from one command to become input for another.

```bash
[student@studentvm1 ~]$ w
[student@studentvm1 ~]$ w | tail -n +3
[student@studentvm1 ~]$ w | tail -n +3 | awk '{print $1}'
[student@studentvm1 ~]$ w | tail -n +3 | awk '{print $1}' | sort
[student@studentvm1 ~]$ w | tail -n +3 | awk '{print $1}' | sort | uniq
```

Each step transforms the stream:
1. `w`: who is logged in
2. `tail`: skip header
3. `awk`: extract usernames
4. `sort`: alphabetical order
5. `uniq`: remove duplicates

Use `|&` to include STDERR in the pipeline:

```bash
command |& tee errorlog.txt
```

---

## Redirection

Redirect STDOUT:

```bash
[student@studentvm1 ~]$ df -h > diskusage.txt
```

View output:

```bash
[student@studentvm1 ~]$ cat diskusage.txt
```

Redirect STDIN:

```bash
[student@studentvm1 ~]$ od -c -N 50 < /dev/urandom
```

---

## grep: Filtering Output

Find USB-related messages in the kernel ring buffer:

```bash
[student@studentvm1 ~]$ dmesg | grep usb
```

`grep` is an essential utility in pipelines to extract meaningful data from streams.

---

Always verify devices before using destructive commands like `dd` or `shred`. It's safest to experiment on USB or virtual disks.

This documentation continues to evolve as more experiments and situations are added.
