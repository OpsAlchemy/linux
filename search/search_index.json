Streams are the foundational building blocks of Unix philosophy: \"Write programs that do one thing and do it well. Write programs to work together. Write programs to handle text streams, because that is a universal interface.\" \u2014 Doug McIlroy STDIO File Handles \u00b6 There are three default STDIO streams: STDIN (File handle 0): Standard Input (usually the keyboard). STDOUT (File handle 1): Standard Output (usually the display). STDERR (File handle 2): Standard Error (also the display). These are implemented in C using the stdio.h header. Each STDIO stream is opened automatically when a program starts. STDIN can be redirected from any file (even device files). STDOUT can be redirected to files or piped to other programs. STDERR is independent and by default sent to the screen. Redirection makes it possible to separate output from errors, improving usability in scripts and pipelines. Basic Commands and Their Outputs \u00b6 [ root@studentvm1 ~ ] # dmesg [ root@studentvm1 ~ ] # lsblk -i View disk partitions: [ root@studentvm1 ~ ] # fdisk -l /dev/sdb [ root@studentvm1 ~ ] # mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt Ensure you verify the USB drive path on your VM before running commands. It may vary (e.g., /dev/sdb , /dev/sdc ). Generating Data Streams with yes \u00b6 The yes command generates a continuous stream of data. It can: Demonstrate piping behavior Confirm deletions automatically Fill storage for testing Example: [ student@studentvm1 ~ ] $ yes 123465789 -abcdefg Interrupt using Ctrl+C (^C). To test deletion confirmation: yes | rm * ll Make sure /mnt is the current working directory before executing the above. Filling a Drive (Testing Directory Full Scenarios) \u00b6 Watch filesystem usage: [ root@studentvm1 ~ ] # watch -n 1 df -h Fill with repeating data: [ root@studentvm1 ~ ] # yes 123456789-abcdefgh >> /mnt/testfile.txt Clean up: [ root@studentvm1 ~ ] # rm -f /mnt/testfile.txt ; umount /mnt Real-World Use Case \u00b6 When /tmp is full, GUI login may fail because desktop sessions write to /tmp . CLI logins may still work because they don't need /tmp writes. Exploring Disk with dd \u00b6 Read the boot sector: [ root@studentvm1 ~ ] # dd if=/dev/sdb bs=512 count=1 Useful for analyzing partition layout. Binary and unreadable without interpretation. Understanding that dd can also read from partition devices (e.g., /dev/sdb1 ) helps in studying filesystem structures. If trying to locate file data manually, you may: - Start reading from the first partition - Skip empty space between boot sector and first partition - Use less to scroll output if terminal is too small Working with Random Data \u00b6 Generate random bytes for testing or data wiping: [ student@studentvm1 ~ ] $ od -c -N 50 < /dev/urandom Use dd to write random data to a disk (be cautious!): [ root@studentvm1 ~ ] # dd if=/dev/urandom of=/dev/sda This is useful for: - Data destruction - Forensics testing - Ensuring irrecoverable deletions Alternative: Use shred for secure file erasure: [ root@studentvm1 ~ ] # shred -vzn 3 /dev/sdb -v : verbose -z : add a final pass of zeros -n 3 : overwrite 3 times Piping and Pipelines \u00b6 The | operator allows output from one command to become input for another.

You\u2019ll learn how to use standard input/output/error, redirection, pipes, real-time monitoring, and inter-process communication. Part 1: Core Stream Operations \u00b6 Challenge 1: Redirect Output to a File \u00b6 Task Write the string Learning Linux Streams into a file named streams.txt . Solution echo \"Learning Linux Streams\" > streams.txt Concept The > operator redirects standard output (STDOUT) to a file. If the file exists, it\u2019s overwritten. Challenge 2: Redirect Only Errors \u00b6 Task List contents of /etc and a non-existent directory. Redirect only the error output to a file named errors.log . Solution ls /etc /nonexistent 2 > errors.log Concept File descriptor 2 refers to standard error (STDERR). Using 2> allows redirecting error messages separately from standard output. Challenge 3: Combine Output and Errors \u00b6 Task Repeat the previous command, but redirect both STDOUT and STDERR to a file named combined.log . Solution ls /etc /nonexistent > combined.log 2 > & 1 Concept 2>&1 tells the shell to send STDERR to the same place as STDOUT. This way, all output (success + error) goes into one file. Challenge 4: Read Input from User \u00b6 Task Create a Bash script that asks for user input and prints it back. Solution ( input_echo.sh ) #!/bin/bash read -p \"Enter something: \" input echo \"You entered: $input \" Concept read takes input from STDIN (usually the keyboard). echo writes it to STDOUT. Challenge 5: Read Input from a File \u00b6 Task Feed input into a script from a file instead of typing manually. Solution Create input.txt : echo \"streamed text\" > input.txt Run script: ./input_echo.sh < input.txt Concept < redirects a file into the STDIN of a command or script. Part 2: Intermediate Stream Manipulation \u00b6 Challenge 6: Filter Output via Pipes \u00b6 Task Create a file with multiple lines. Use cat and grep to display only lines containing a certain word. Solution cat > sample.txt <<EOF apple banana grape apple pie EOF cat sample.txt | grep apple Concept The | (pipe) takes the STDOUT of cat and passes it as STDIN to grep . This is called stream chaining. Challenge 7: Save and Display Output Simultaneously \u00b6 Task Display a message on the screen and save it to a file at the same time. Solution echo \"Logging this\" | tee output.log Concept tee writes STDOUT to both the terminal and the specified file. Challenge 8: Monitor File Changes in Real Time \u00b6 Task Follow changes to a log file live and display lines containing a specific keyword. Solution tail -f /var/log/syslog | grep \"sshd\" Concept tail -f outputs new lines as they\u2019re written to the file. Piping it to grep allows real-time filtering. Challenge 9: Compare Directory Listings Using Process Substitution \u00b6 Task Compare contents of two directories using diff without temporary files. Solution diff < ( ls /etc ) < ( ls /usr ) Concept <(...) is process substitution, which allows a command\u2019s output to be treated like a file. Challenge 10: Log CPU Usage with Timestamp \u00b6 Task Create a loop that logs CPU usage every second along with a timestamp. Solution while true ; do echo \" $( date +%T ) $( vmstat 1 2 | tail -1 | awk '{print $13+$14}' ) \" sleep 1 done | tee cpu_usage.log Concept vmstat shows CPU stats, date provides timestamps, and tee logs to file while showing real-time output. Part 3: Advanced Streaming and IPC \u00b6 Challenge 11: Use a Named Pipe ( mkfifo ) \u00b6 Task Create a FIFO, write to it from one terminal, and read from it in another. Solution mkfifo mypipe Terminal 1: cat mypipe Terminal 2: echo \"Hello via pipe\" > mypipe Concept Named pipes enable communication between processes using the filesystem, acting as a stream between them. Challenge 12: Stream Logs from a Remote Host \u00b6 Task Use SSH to stream logs from a remote machine and filter them. Solution ssh user@remote-host 'tail -f /var/log/syslog' | grep \"nginx\" Concept Combines remote execution and local filtering. Useful for centralized log processing and monitoring. Challenge 13: Real-Time Alert on Failed SSH Attempts \u00b6 Task Watch authentication logs and alert when failed login attempts occur. Solution tail -F /var/log/auth.log | grep --line-buffered \"Failed password\" | while read line ; do echo \"[ALERT] $line \" done Concept Monitors a log file in real time, filters it, and triggers an action for each matching line. Challenge 14: Format and Color Output from Stream \u00b6 Task Create a script that reads from STDIN and formats the output (e.g., with timestamps or color codes). Solution while read line ; do echo -e \"\\033[1;32m[ $( date +%T ) ] $line \\033[0m\" done Use it with: cat sample.txt | ./formatter.sh Concept Adding ANSI codes to STDOUT allows dynamic formatting in the terminal (e.g., colors, timestamps). Challenge 15: Parallel Stream Processing \u00b6 Task Process a single stream in multiple ways: log it, compress it, and display it live. Solution your_command | tee > ( gzip > out.gz ) > ( logger -t mystream ) Concept Combines tee with process substitution to split a stream into multiple destinations without duplicating commands. Summary \u00b6 This lab covers: Core redirection ( > , < , 2> , 2>&1 ) Input/output chaining via pipes Real-time monitoring Process substitution Named pipes for IPC Stream branching with tee Integration with remote systems and logging tools This is foundational knowledge for Linux administration, DevOps automation, log aggregation, and real-time data processing.","title":"Practices"},{"location":"2.1.%20data-streams-practices/#linux-streams-practice-lab-stdin-stdout-stderr-and-advanced-streams","text":"This lab walks you through 15 exercises that build a strong foundation in Linux data streams.

Best Practices: \u00b6 Controlled Environment: Avoid running stress tests on production systems. Continuous Monitoring: Use htop , nmon , or sar during tests. Data Logging: Save output for analysis. Core Utilization: Bind processes to specific cores using taskset . 6. Summary: \u00b6 Stress testing with stress , stress-ng , fio , and iperf3 combined with monitoring using top , htop , ps , sar , and nmon provides a robust framework for performance evaluation and bottleneck identification. Kill \u00b6 Comprehensive Notes on the kill Command in Linux \u00b6 1. Introduction: \u00b6 The kill command in Linux is used to terminate processes by sending signals. It is an essential tool for process management, allowing you to stop, pause, or restart processes. 2. Basic Syntax: \u00b6 kill [ options ] <PID> PID: Process ID of the process to be killed. Options: Different signals to control the process. 3. Commonly Used Signals with kill : \u00b6 Signal Number Description SIGHUP 1 Hangup - Restart the process. SIGINT 2 Interrupt - Usually stops the process (like Ctrl+C). SIGQUIT 3 Quit - Terminates the process and generates a core dump. SIGTERM 15 Terminate - Graceful termination (default). SIGKILL 9 Kill - Forcefully terminate the process. SIGSTOP 19 Stop - Pauses the process. SIGCONT 18 Continue - Resumes a stopped process. 4. Killing Processes by PID: \u00b6 4.1 Basic Kill: \u00b6 kill <PID> # Sends SIGTERM (default) kill -15 <PID> # Explicitly send SIGTERM kill -9 <PID> # Force kill (SIGKILL) 4.2 Multiple PIDs: \u00b6 kill -9 1234 5678 91011 # Kills multiple processes 5. Killing Processes by Name: \u00b6 5.1 Using killall : \u00b6 killall python3 # Kills all running Python3 processes killall -9 firefox # Forcefully kill all Firefox instances 5.2 Using pkill : \u00b6 pkill python3 # Kill processes by name pkill -9 bash # Force kill all bash processes pkill -f \"python3 script.py\" # Kill processes matching full command 5.3 Killing User-Specific Processes: \u00b6 pkill -u azureuser # Kill all processes owned by 'azureuser' pkill -9 -u azureuser python3 # Forcefully kill all Python processes of the user 6. Killing Processes Using ps and grep : \u00b6 ps aux | grep nginx # Find process ID of nginx kill -9 $( pgrep nginx ) # Kill all nginx processes Example: Killing Specific PIDs: \u00b6 ps -ef | grep python3 # List all Python3 processes kill -9 1234 5678 # Kill processes by listed PIDs 7. Advanced Kill Commands: \u00b6 7.1 Killing Child Processes: \u00b6 pkill -P <parent_PID> # Kill all children of a parent process 7.2 Killing All Processes of a Specific User: \u00b6 pkill -u john # Kill all processes started by user 'john' sudo pkill -9 -u root # Forcefully kill all root user processes 7.3 Killing Processes by TTY: \u00b6 pkill -t pts/1 # Kill all processes associated with TTY pts/1 8. Handling Stubborn Processes: \u00b6 8.1 Identifying Unresponsive Processes: \u00b6 top -o %CPU # Check for processes with high CPU usage ps -eo pid,ppid,%cpu,%mem,cmd --sort = -%cpu # Sort processes by CPU usage 8.2 Force Killing: \u00b6 kill -9 <PID> # Last resort - force kill pkill -9 -f \"command_name\" # Kill by matching the full command 9. Killing Background Jobs: \u00b6 9.1 Listing Background Jobs: \u00b6 jobs # Show background jobs in the current session 9.2 Killing a Specific Job: \u00b6 kill %1 # Kill the first background job kill -9 %2 # Force kill the second background job 10. Checking Signal Status: \u00b6 kill -l # List all available signals Common Signal Status: \u00b6 kill -l SIGTERM # Check the number corresponding to SIGTERM 11. Special Kill Commands: \u00b6 11.1 Killing Processes with xargs : \u00b6 pgrep -f my_script | xargs kill -9 # Kill processes matching 'my_script' 11.2 Using Signal Names Instead of Numbers: \u00b6 kill -SIGKILL <PID> # Same as kill -9 kill -SIGTERM <PID> # Same as kill -15 12. Troubleshooting Kill Failures: \u00b6 12.1 Reasons for Failure: \u00b6 Permissions Issue: Trying to kill a root process without sudo. Zombie Process: The process is defunct and cannot be killed directly. Stubborn Process: The process may be in an uninterruptible sleep state (D state). 12.2 Dealing with Stubborn Processes: \u00b6 sudo kill -9 <PID> # Use superuser privileges pkill -9 -f \"command_name\" # Use pkill for complex matches 12.3 Removing Zombie Processes: \u00b6 Zombies do not consume resources but remain in the process table. Identify the parent process (PPID) and kill it: ps -eo pid,ppid,stat,cmd | grep Z # Find zombies kill -9 <PPID> # Kill the parent process 13. Real-World Examples: \u00b6 Example 1: Kill All Python Scripts by User: \u00b6 pkill -u user123 python3 # Stops all Python scripts run by 'user123' Example 2: Force Kill Chrome Browser: \u00b6 killall -9 chrome # Stops all Chrome processes Example 3: Kill Background Jobs: \u00b6 jobs # List jobs kill %1 # Kill job number 1 Example 4: Kill Processes Based on Resource Usage: \u00b6 ps -eo pid,%mem,%cpu,cmd --sort = -%mem | head # List top memory consumers kill -9 $( pgrep -f \"heavy_script.py\" ) # Kill the most memory-consuming script 14. Summary: \u00b6 kill , killall , and pkill are essential for terminating processes. Signals can gracefully terminate or forcefully kill processes. Use kill -9 for unresponsive processes, but prefer kill -15 for graceful shutdown. Combine ps , pgrep , and grep for efficient process management. Use jobs and % to manage background tasks within the current session.
